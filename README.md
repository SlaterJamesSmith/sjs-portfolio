### Features
This project contains:
- A custom nav animated menu
- Clickable video content
- Responsiveness to viewport size
- Custom Javascript code to correctly time CSS animations and avoid UI bugs.

### Roadmap
This project is not yet finished. It still needs:
- Finalized phone view designs for full responsiveness.
- Finalized text copy and images for 'comms + design'
- All content for 'about-me' section needs to be added
- Functional sub-menu buttons for animations and navigating between sections
- Apply 'cursor: pointer' or 'cursor: default' css rules for all clickable content.
- Refactored SCSS code. Current code is very repetitive and not DRY enough
- Live links
- Deployment to custom URL address

### Technologies Used
- jQuery
- SASS / SCSS
